I am a first-year PhD student at the Department of Statistics of the University of Oxford, supervised by [Yee Whye Teh](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/) and funded by [Aker Scholarship](https://www.akerscholarship.no/eng).

I am generally interested in the methodology and theory of machine learning. My recent research interests include symmetries in deep learning, uncertainty estimation and neural architecture search. I also especially enjoy areas of ML involving applications of pure math. 

Before starting my PhD, I completed a bachelor's in math at the University of Oxford and a master's in math (Part III) at the University of Cambridge, mostly specializing in algebra and topology.

You might find my first name difficult to pronounce -- the short version is Sheh (pronounced 'Sha'). :grin:
